commit
- On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, 
which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture
the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

branch
- When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master 
as it was at that point in time.

Pull Request (PR)
- Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
