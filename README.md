commit
- On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, 
which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture
the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

branch
- When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master 
as it was at that point in time.
